- `Ctrl+Alt+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Alt+P`): **Quick Switch Project**

## Usage

### Viewing Work Items

1. Open the Azure DevOps panel from the Activity Bar
2. View your sprint board organized by state (To Do, In Progress, Done, Removed)
3. View your assigned work items in the "My Work Items" section
4. Click on any work item to view full details in a webview panel

### Switching Projects

Press `Ctrl+Alt+P` to quickly switch between projects:
- Shows your 10 most recently used projects
- One-click switching
- Automatically reloads work items
- Current project shown in status bar

### Changing Work Item Status

Two methods:
1. **Via webview**: Open a work item and use the state dropdown
2. **Via command**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+U` and select work item and new state

The state dropdown dynamically shows only valid state transitions for your Azure DevOps workflow configuration.

### Generating Descriptions with AI

When viewing a work item without a description:
1. A yellow banner appears: "⚠️ This work item is missing a description. Would you like to generate one with AI?"
2. Click "Generate with AI"
3. Wait 2-3 seconds while AI generates a context-aware description
4. The description is automatically saved to Azure DevOps

**What context does AI use?**
- Work item title
- Work item type (Task, User Story, Bug, etc.)
- Area path (team/feature context)
- Iteration path (sprint context)
- Tags

**Why Azure OpenAI?**
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Data stays in your Azure region
- Predictable pricing through Azure subscriptions
- Same models as OpenAI, hosted in Azure

### Filtering Work Items

Use the Command Palette:
- "Toggle Show/Hide Completed Items" - Hide/show Done/Closed/Resolved items
- "Toggle Show/Hide Removed Items" - Hide/show Removed/Cut items
- "Clear All Filters" - Show all work items
